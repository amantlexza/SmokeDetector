# SmokeDetector
You have been given the following components to build a smoke detection system 
1. 1 x MQ-2 gas sensor 
2. 1 x piezo buzzer 
3. 1 x red LED 
4. 1 X 16by2 LCD 
5. 1 x normally open pushbutton 
6. Various resistors 

When the gas sensor detects dangerous levels of smoke, the red LED is going to flash and the buzzer will sound an alarm until the pushbutton has been pressed to reset the system. The LCD should communicate the state of the system at all times. You are encouraged to expand the system to make it more market ready.
